# GitHub account ownership

Unlike most enterprise systems, GitHub's user model separates ownership of accounts and organisations. Within Hackney we follow this model.

## The `LBHackney-IT` organisation

Hackney owns and manages the [LBHackney-IT organisation](https://github.com/LBHackney-IT). Any repositories, Actions, etc. within the organisation are owned and controlled by us, and we have various security controls in place. Therefore all Hackney-owned repositories _must_ reside within the `LBHackney-IT` organisation.

## User accounts

User accounts are personally owned, and may be used for other activities on GitHub outside of Hackney.

### Do I need to create a new account when I join Hackney?

You have two options when you join Hackney that are equally valid:

1. Use your existing GitHub account. This is the most common choice, and enables you to keep all your contribution history in one place, and contribute to work and personal projects without needing to switch accounts.

2. Create a new account, separate from your existing account. You may prefer to have strong separation between work and personal projects, in which case a fresh account dedicated to Hackney makes sense. Typically this involves adding `LBH` as a prefix of suffix to the username. You'll still own this account if you leave, and may choose to delete it.
